  descripe_l1_person: "I have been in software development for 26 years and been with Genesys since 2015. I spent the last 5 years working and leading the 
  Edge Infrastructure Team at Genesys Cloud. In this role, I lead a team of developer managing a portfolio of 17 tier-0 services written in Java, Kotlin, Go and Clojure.  In addition,
  my team saw the automated provisioning and upgrading of thousands of telephony servers spread across 9 AWS regions.  Recently, I took on the challenge of 
  launching the Genesys Cloud Developer Engagement team.
  <br/><br/>
  Before coming to Genesys, I was an Integration Architect at a Fortune 300 financial services company and a member of their critical response team.
