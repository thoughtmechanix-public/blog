Writing is often a lonely task. It starts often with an idea and an itch to share that idea. Even small efforts (like a blog post) can turn into exercises in frustration as you struggle to get your ideas shaped and then on paper. It often involves spending significant amount of time by yourself and denying that time to friends and family. It's not all bad, but it is work and it is journey that requires discipline and a willingness to see a project through the end. Over the course of the many years I have been in software development I have been givent he opportunity to edit and author multiple articles and books. As a I look back over my career I laugh at how many technologies I have written about that have come and gone. But each project had its own unique value. Below is the list of publications that I have participated in over the years. (When possible I included links to the books)
