Architect are technical leaders, but they are more then just top technical talent:
Architects communicate.  (They explain why and help provide the big picture)
Architects collaborate.  (They work across teams to solve a problem.  They often have to be patient and go back to the wll.
Architects learn.  (architects never stop learning about technology, business and process.  The best architects tend to be multi-disciplinary in the way they look at things)
Architects listen.  When an architect is looking a design they look for historical context of design decisions, they listen to their engineering staff to understand the "ities" of problems they are working.
