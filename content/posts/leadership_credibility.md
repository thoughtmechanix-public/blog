Leadership credibility.  We only have so much of it.  Dont burn it all on being right
We only have so many guns of our bullets.  You build credibility through contributions to the community. Competence
You burn credibility:

1.  Letting emotion into your decision making process
2.  Denigrating other groups within the organization
3.  Refusing to work with other individuals or teams.
4.  Coming across as crass 
5.  Looking down at others
